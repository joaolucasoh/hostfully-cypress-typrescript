# Cypress Project with TypeScript

This project demonstrates how to set up and run end-to-end tests using Cypress with TypeScript support.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. This project is tested with Node.js version 14.x and above.

- To check your Node.js version, run the following command in a terminal (macOS) or command prompt (Windows):

  ```bash
  node -v
  ```

- If you need to install or update Node.js, visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) to download the version appropriate for your operating system.

## Project Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git.

   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repository-url.com/cypress-typescript-project.git
   cd cypress-typescript-project
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Within the project directory, run the following command to install all required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or, if you prefer using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **TypeScript Configuration**

   This project should already include a `tsconfig.json` file configured for use with Cypress. Make sure to review and adjust this configuration as necessary for your specific project.

## Running Tests

To run Cypress tests interactively:

```bash
npx cypress open
```

To run Cypress tests in headless mode (useful for CI/CD):

```bash
npx cypress run
```

## Project Structure

- `cypress/integration/` - Directory where your test files should be placed.
- `cypress/plugins/` - Directory for Cypress plugins. You might need to modify the `index.js` file here to add TypeScript support.
- `cypress/support/` - Directory for support files, where you can define custom Cypress commands or override existing behaviors.
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration file for the project.

## Support
